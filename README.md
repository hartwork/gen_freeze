# gen_freeze

## About

The *Freeze Winamp Plugin* (a.k.a. **gen_freeze**) started out in response to a
[question by user `BastardKidKris`](http://forums.winamp.com/showthread.php?postid=1882096)
at the official Winamp community forum in 2006.
The plugin allows to lock certain Winamp windows in place
so that you don't move them by mistake.
